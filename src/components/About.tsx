                <p className="text-muted-foreground">
                  Starting as a passionate visual storyteller, I've evolved into a motion designer who believes 
                  that every frame tells a story. My journey has been shaped by countless hours of experimentation, 
                  learning from industry leaders, and pushing the boundaries of what's possible in motion graphics.

                <p className="text-muted-foreground">
                  I create motion graphics that don't just look beautifulâ€”they communicate, inspire, and connect. 
                  My purpose is to transform complex ideas into engaging visual narratives that resonate with 
                  audiences and drive meaningful connections between brands and their communities.
